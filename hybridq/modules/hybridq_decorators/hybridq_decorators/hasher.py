    Enable `hash` for arbitrary objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    keys: str, optional
        A string containing valid keys (separated by a comma) to add to the
        type object. If provided, only `keys` will be used to compute the hash.
    method: callable, optional
        Method to use to hash object. By default, the hash value of the pickled
        object is used.

    Example
    -------
    import pickle

    @hasher
    class A(list):

    hash([1, 2, 3])
    > TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
